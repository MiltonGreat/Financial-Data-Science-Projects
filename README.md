# Financial-Data-Science-Projects

This collection of projects explores key applications of data science in the financial sector. These projects simulate real-world financial scenarios using public datasets, and were developed to strengthen both technical and analytical skills. Each repository focuses on a core financial challenge:

[Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Time-Series-Forecasting)
This repository shows projects that deal with time series analysis in the financial industry for forecasting, risk modeling, and anomaly detection. Here are some datasets where I apply time series techniques to simulate realistic financial scenarios and refine my data science skills.

[Fairness in Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Fairness-in-Machine-Learning-Models)
The respository shows projects that applying fairness in machine learning for financial scenarios, especially in credit risk modeling, lending, and fraud detection. Here are some datasets where I simulated bias detection, fairness auditing, and mitigation techniques in financial decision-making

[Credit Risk Modelling](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Credit-Risk-Modelling)
This repository shows the use cases for applying credit risk regulatory requirements to credit risk models. I used various datasets that involve credit risk assessment, loan defaults, and financial modeling.

[Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Anomaly-Detection-in-Financial)
This repository shows projects dealing with anomaly detection in finance for fraud detection, risk assessment, and trading anomalies. Here are datasets where I applied anomaly detection techniques to simulate realistic financial scenarios and refine my data science skills.

[Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Portfolio-Optimization)
This repository shows projects that deal with portfolio management, trading strategies, risk analysis, fraud detection, and ethical investing.
